# Time Clock Management System

The Time Clock Management System streamlines attendance and work hour management for organizational efficiency. Employees can log in, clock in at the start of their workday, and clock out upon completion. The system meticulously records work hours, ensuring precise time tracking and simplified payroll management. Administrators have easy access to review employee work hours and attendance records.
